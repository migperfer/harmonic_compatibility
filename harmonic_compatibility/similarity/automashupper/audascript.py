"""Tests the audacity pipe.
Keep pipe_test.py short!!
You can make more complicated longer tests to test other functionality
or to generate screenshots etc in other scripts.
Make sure Audacity is running first and that mod-script-pipe is enabled
before running this script.
Requires Python 2.7 or later. Python 3 is strongly recommended.
